### Image Stitching Developer Guide

Please read before starting making your project file.

#### FAQ

* Q: I failed to build samples

Download the origin [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) source code here, then copy "samples" folder to your source code folder.

* Q: Can't find out which .cpp to run

"stitching_detailed.cpp" in the root folder.

* Q: Shall I install my OpenCV dlls

It will do something good but not necessary.

* Q: It doesn't work!

Try switching to master branch.

#### Additional libraries

You may need some additional libraries to run the sample such as

* Clapack: <http://www.netlib.org/clapack/> or Lapack
* Sba: <http://users.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/sba/>
* Pcl: <http://pointclouds.org/>
* Tbb: <https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download>

All above are NOT necessary.
